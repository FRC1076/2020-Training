Simple RPG

This is a very simple RPG game in which the game promts the user
for a diretion to move, and the game respodns with their fate
(Fall in hole, killed by spider, find treasure...)


If this seems like fun, you could expand it as we learn
more python, making this into a cool project


Concepts:
Boolean Logic
